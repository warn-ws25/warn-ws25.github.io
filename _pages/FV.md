Francesco Vigni is a licensed information engineer and PhD student funded by the EU project PERSEO and part of the PriscaLab based at University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy. He is also affiliated with the Interdepartmental Center for Advances in Robotic Surgery (ICAROS) and enrolled in the graduate school Information and Communication Technology for Health (ICTH) of the same university. He received his M.Sc in computer and automation engineering with honors at University of Siena in Italy.
